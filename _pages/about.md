I am a first-year Ph.D. student at CMU LTI, advised by [Prof. Sherry Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) at the [WInE Lab🍷](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/group.html). 

I did my master at [THUKEG](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Juanzi Li](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) and [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). I visited [CLIP Lab@UMD](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) in 2024 where I work with [Prof. Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). 

I obtained my Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economy ([PPE](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1111/1373.htm)) and a minor in Psychology at Tsinghua University. 

I have a broad interest in social sciences and cognitive sciences, receiving research training in these interdisciplinary fields. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).


Research
------

As a researcher in AI and NLP, I am dedicated to understanding advanced models from the perspectives of intelligence and cognition, and to developing AI systems and applications that truly benefit humanity and society. Some of the projects I worked on are listed below:

1. **Cognitively Understanding and Improving Language Models**: [Cognitive Diagnostic of LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.111/), [EmoBench](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.326/), [Arithmetic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05845), [KoLA](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/poster/19238).
2. **AI for Education**: [SimClass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19226), [MAIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03512v1), [Slide2Lecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07372), [LittleMu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05935).

When I'm not doing research, I’m passionate about sports, especially basketball and track and field. I hold the standing long jump record at Tsinghua University (3.22m). I love music, reading, and movies, which keep me thoughtful, enthusiastic, and fulfilling.
